This dataset contains weather and energy load data for New Delhi, India, spanning from January 1, 2013, to April 30, 2016. It has been sourced from the State Load Dispatch Center (SLDC) in Delhi and provides a comprehensive record of temperature, humidity, and energy demand during the specified period.

The data is ideal for time series analysis, particularly peak load forecasting, and is suitable for academic research, machine learning, and data science projects focused on energy demand prediction and climate impact analysis.

Key Features:

**Year, Month, Date:** Structured date components to facilitate time-based analysis.

**Max.Temp. (°C):** The highest recorded temperature for each day.

**Min.Temp. (°C):** The lowest recorded temperature for each day.

**Relative Humidity (Morning):** Recorded at 0830 IST.

**Relative Humidity (Evening):** Recorded at 1730 IST.

**Load (MW):** Daily peak energy load in megawatts (MW).

Data Highlights:
 Covers three years and four months of data, capturing both seasonal variations and annual trends in energy demand.
 Includes the influence of weather conditions (temperature and humidity) on energy consumption.
 High-resolution data suitable for ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet models to forecast energy demand.

Potential Use Cases:

 Forecasting Peak Load Demand: Ideal for predicting future energy requirements based on historical data and weather patterns.
 Weather Impact Analysis: Study how temperature and humidity influence energy consumption trends.
 Energy Planning and Optimization: Support decision-making for energy resource management and peak load handling.

Note:
The dataset is private and curated for research purposes.
Attribution to **SLDC Delhi (State Load Dispatch Center, Delhi)** is required if used for academic or publication purposes.
